The project is an online stock trading simulation used for educational purposes. I was the person in charge of the front end and made almost everything in it, thus I am only showcasing the front-end.
The "vite-project" folder is the folder containing the front end for the project which was made using React, TypeScript and plain CSS. Bootstrap was also used occasionally to speed up the workflow. 
The handling of promises is made in a very chaotic way because they were rushed. I only got api endpoints late in the project, so I had to quickly finish them to meet the required deadline.

There is an mp4 file included which showcases the projects
